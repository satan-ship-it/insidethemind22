    <!-- Chosen Palette: Blue Gradient Theme (matching index.html) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a continuous vertical scroll structure, presenting all five major thematic sections (Introduction, Goals, Process, Methods, Ethics) sequentially. This structure was chosen to convert the document into a linear reading experience, much like a textbook chapter, while retaining interactivity. Large vertical padding and bold, distinct headers are used to clearly separate each theme. All internal interactions (like the Goals selection and Methods tabs) remain within their respective sections, ensuring the user is not distracted by global navigation and can focus on the content flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: Goals of Enquiry -> Goal: Inform & Organize -> Viz: Interactive cards -> Interaction: Click to reveal details. Justification: More engaging than a list, focuses user attention. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
    - Report Info: Steps in Research -> Goal: Show Process -> Viz: Interactive flowchart diagram -> Interaction: Click on a step to see details. Justification: Visually represents the sequence, making it more intuitive than text. Method: HTML/Tailwind CSS/JS.
    - Report Info: Comparison of Methods -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Radar Chart -> Interaction: Visual comparison of multiple criteria. Justification: Provides a quick, multi-dimensional comparison. Library: Chart.js.
    - Report Info: Correlational Research Types -> Goal: Explain Relationships -> Viz: Scatter Plot -> Interaction: Buttons to switch between correlation examples. Justification: Visually demonstrates abstract statistical concepts. Library: Chart.js.
    - Report Info: Ethical Issues -> Goal: Organize & Inform -> Viz: Accordion component -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse. Justification: Prevents information overload and keeps the UI clean. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
